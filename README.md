I use Sublime Text as my code editor, and so this repo will hold my user
settings so that I have the same settings for development.

Clone the repo
`git clone git@github.com:shyamsalimkumar/sublime-text-3-settings.git`

Then `sh setupSymlinks.sh` to get the symlinks for this setup.

### Notes

I use Ubuntu as my OS so at the time of this writing the paths are specific for
Ubuntu.
